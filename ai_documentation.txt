Input: How to add a git-tag to repostiory 

Output: # Create a tag (lightweight)
git tag v1.0

# Or create an annotated tag (recommended - includes message)
git tag -a v1.0 -m "Initial release with selected data files"

# Push the tag to GitHub
git push origin v1.0

# Or push all tags at once
git push origin --tags

My process: I tried to tweak some of the code and realized I need to commit the whole folder first.
